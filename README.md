# LQ-Equiv
For a first installation:

- Read the MIT licence terms, 
  
- Download and install on the PC, the matlab runtime component file MCR (https://fr.mathworks.com/products/compiler/matlab-runtime.html),
  
- Download and install on the PC, the file LQL-equiv.exe available in the folder called Soft,
  
- Read the help file which describe the good use of the soft.
  

Note that for install a soft update, it's no necessary to re-install the MCR file.

Source codes are available to custom the software, however, it is not recommended to use a customized version during actual radiotherapy treatments. It is the user's responsibility to verify and validate the changes made. 

In the event of a problem, contact the owners of the codes (Daniel Julian or Cyril Voyant) via cyrilvoyant@gmail.com or julian.mpsolution@gmail.com

Any publication (or use) of results from simulations made with LQ-Equiv or with a customized version must mention:
