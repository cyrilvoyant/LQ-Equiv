# Contributing to LQ-Equiv

Thanks for your interest! Quick guidelines:

1. Open an issue before starting larger changes.
2. Create a descriptive branch: `feature/xyz` or `fix/typo`.
3. Keep commits focused and with clear messages.
4. Open a Pull Request against `main` and provide a short description of the change.
5. A basic linter runs on PRs (Markdown/HTML).

Binaries
- If you add compiled binaries, include a checksum (SHA256) and build instructions to allow verification.

If you want issue/PR templates or a CODE_OF_CONDUCT, I can add them in a follow-up commit.
